# Notes for the power user
## Higher dimensions to simple notes
Wysgy aims to increase the clarity of note taking. It uses [cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive/) for the GUI. 

## Portability
Wysgy notes, relationships are simply files. A wysgy project is a collection of your notes and relationship files describing the interconnects. It also contains the files you may have added with `wysgy file`. It becomes a self-contained, portable folder that can be backed up with git, dropbox, google drive, whatever you prefer.

## Installation

    `cargo install wysgy`
